# Green Pulse

**Green Pulse is a dynamic web application built to manage and track community challenges, user submissions, and member projects.**

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Managing community-driven projects, tracking member participation in various challenges, and reviewing submissions can be disorganized and time-consuming without a centralized platform. Organizations and administrators often lack clear visibility into user engagement, making it difficult to reward contributions and monitor overall progress efficiently.

## 2. Solution
Green Pulse provides a unified platform where members can easily view active challenges, submit their work (such as project URLs), and track their reward points. Administrators are equipped with a powerful dashboard featuring data visualization to effortlessly manage user accounts, create new challenges, and securely review member submissions.

- **Data Fetching:** [TanStack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is used for efficient server state management, caching, and background synchronization.
- **State Management:** Local client state (like UI toggles and persistent user preferences) is managed via [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/).
- **Routing:** Built on the modern Next.js App Router paradigm utilizing server components alongside client components for optimal performance and SEO.
